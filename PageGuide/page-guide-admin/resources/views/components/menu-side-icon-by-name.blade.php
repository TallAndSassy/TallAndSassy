 After some experimenting - just put your icons in the $slot for your menus. Don't waste time making icons reusable, especially now that you can just copy svg code right from these sites.

 If you see something like: ErrorException Svg by name "o-homeasdf" from set "heroicons" not found
 [ ] Did you put 'x-' in fro                nt.  You shouldn't use 'heroicon-o-home', not 'x-heroicon-o-home
 [ ] Did you need to install this font kit, like 'composer require blade-ui-kit/blade-heroicons' as specified on the
     https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons/heroicon-o-home
 Try visiting https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons
 You can basically shrink the icon, and maybe increase it, but we need standard spacing, so we wrap it in a w-6 div.
